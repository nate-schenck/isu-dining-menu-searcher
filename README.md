# isu-dining-menu-searcher
My first project with JavaFX and JSoup. Uses the information from the ISU Dining website to search the menu days in advance.

If you're trying to use this on your own...
1. Open the application
2. Type in the keyword you would like to search
3. Type in the number of days you would like to see into the future
4. Hit "Search"... then wait a little bit
5. The area below the text fields should populate with the date and location of items that match your keyword.
